Dear Anthropic Team,

I'm excited to submit my application for the Research Engineer, Agents position. As a contributor to the ElizaOS agent framework and developer of production autonomous systems processing $2M+ in transactions, I bring unique experience in the core areas of your agent research: planning, reliable execution, tool use, and multi-agent coordination.

My background combines production agent deployment with Constitutional AI research—implementing safety-conscious autonomous systems that operate reliably in high-stakes environments. I've built comprehensive evaluation frameworks and contributed to major open-source agent infrastructure, experience that aligns closely with Anthropic's systematic approach to agent development.

Key differentiators I bring to the role:
• **Production Agent Experience**: Real-world deployment of autonomous systems with 99.7% reliability
• **Constitutional AI Implementation**: Practical experience with safety constraints and agent alignment
• **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Complex systems coordinating planning, analysis, and execution agents
• **Systematic Evaluation**: Empirical frameworks for agent behavior assessment and optimization
• **Open Source Contribution**: Core contributor to ElizaOS framework (15K+ GitHub stars)

I'm particularly drawn to Anthropic's mission of building helpful, honest, and harmless AI systems. My work has consistently prioritized safety-first design and empirical validation—principles that align perfectly with your approach to trustworthy AI development.

**Attached materials:**
- Resume (optimized for agent research)
- Cover letter (detailed connection to Anthropic's research priorities)  
- Technical project portfolio (in-depth analysis of agent systems work)

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my agent development experience and production deployment insights could contribute to making Claude an even more effective agent. Thank you for your consideration—I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,  
Mitchell Marfinetz
